# Deep Learning Models for Ship Trajectory Prediction

- This repository provides implementations of **six widely used deep learning models** for ship trajectory prediction tasks. 

  ## ðŸ“˜ Included Models

  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
  - **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**
  - **Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)**
  - **Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU)**
  - **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)**
  - **Transformer**

  Each model is implemented using Python and a popular deep learning framework (PyTorch), and is structured for ease of understanding, training, and testing.
